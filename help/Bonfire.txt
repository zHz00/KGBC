#=== INFORMATION ===

*About discounts*

In the bottom line is located information about current
metaphysics discount (% to ratio).

Some buildings have base discount, set in the **Workshop**
tab.

If the discount is active, building have additional text
in square brackets:

Lib      Liberalism (affects _Temple_, _Mint_ and _Tradepost_)
Fas      Fascism (affects _Log House_)
Comm     Communism (affects _Factory_)

_Hut_ have five grades of discount (from 0% to -115%),
which are set also in **Workshop** tab.

*Notice on Spaceport*

_Spaceport_ have unusual ratio for starchart. Sources
show 1.35, but this is misleading. 1.35 is not direct
ratio. Indtead of that common ratio is multiplied by
1.35. So, if you have no _metaphysics_ discounts, your
ratio on starchart will be 1.15\*1.35=1.5525.

If you HAVE _metaphysics_ upgrade, such as _Enlighenment_,
common ratio will receive discount, but 1.35 multiplier
will not. So, the ratio will be 1.14\*1.35=1.539.
