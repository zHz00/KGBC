#=== INFORMATION ===

*Price ratio and discount information.*

All discount information in other screens are just
hints. Real discount information for every building is
displayed on this screen in second line.

**LEFT caption** shows ratio for building. If it is lesser
than default ratio, then default ratio is shown in
parenthesis. If some resource have separate ratio, this
is also shown.

**RIGHT caption** can be absent. This means there is no
discount. If it is present, it shows base price
discount for all resources or for some specific.

*Selection.*

When you use selection, you can see sum of selected
buildings in bottom line. This can help you to estimate
amount of resources needed to build desired amount of
additional buildings.

*[ and ] working details.*

These keys works similarly and there is no difference
between them. First key pressed begins selection. After
that you can move cursor as usual and you will see sum
of selected buildings, but end of selection will move
together with cursor. If you want to move cursor
separately you must end selection with [ or ] key.

*Asterisk in first column.*

Sometimes you see strange asterisk near number of
buildings in first column. This means that buying
indicated number of buildings will give you a new color
scheme.
