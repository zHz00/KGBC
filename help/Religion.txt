#=== INFORMATION ===

*1. Ziggurats.*

Some ziggurats buildings have gold discount from
Liberalism policy. This discount is displayed under
_Ziggurats_ column. This is base price discount,
affecting only gold.

*2. Order of the Sun.*

_Order of the sun_ have complex discount system, which
is described in details in **Workshop help** section. In
short, base gold cost can be reduced with _Liberalism_
policy, the base cost is reduced further with
_Philosofer leader_, _Monarchy_ policy and _Burned Paragon_.

Base cost reduction from _Liberalism_ and from _Philosofer_
_leader_ are multiplied.

**Example.**

_Liberalism_ gives -20% and _Philosofer leader_ gives -10%.

Base cost for gold will be:
0.9\*0.8=0.72, or -28% discount
Base cost for faith will be:
0.9\*1.0=0.9, or -10% discount.

Status of both discounts are displayed in corresponding
column.
