#=== INFORMATION ===

*1. Ziggurats.*

Some buildings from this category receive a gold
discount from _Liberalism_ policy. This discount is
displayed under the _Ziggurats_ column. This is base
price discount, affecting only gold.

*2. Order of the Sun.*

_Order of the sun_ have complex discount system, which
is described in details in **Workshop help** section. In
short, the base cost is reduced with _Philosopher leader_,
whose power can be tuned with _Monarchy_ policy and
_Burned Paragon_. Base gold cost can be reduced further
with _Liberalism_ policy.

Base cost reduction from _Liberalism_ and from _Philosopher_
_leader_ are multiplied.

**Example.**

_Liberalism_ gives -20% (multiplier 0.8) and _Philosopher_
_leader_ gives -10% (multiplier 0.9).

Base cost for gold will be:
0.9\*0.8=0.72, or -28% discount
Base cost for faith will be:
0.9\*1.0=0.9, or -10% discount.

Status of both discounts is displayed in corresponding
column.

*3. Cryptotheology.*

_Cryptotheology_ has no discounts.

Unfortunately, there are too many buildings in this
tab, so there are no letter for _Holy Genocide_. This
building can be selected with '[' key.
