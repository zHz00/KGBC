#=== INFORMATION ===

*About discounts*

There are two types of discounts: ratio discounts and
base discounts. Difference is described in help section
of the **Workshop** tab.

Information about current metaphysics discount (% to 
ratio) is located in the bottom of the screen.

Some buildings also have base discount. It can be set in
the **Workshop** tab.

If base discount is active, certain buildings will have
additional text near their name:

Lib      Liberalism (affects _Temple_, _Mint_ and _Tradepost_)
Fas      Fascism (affects _Log House_)
Comm     Communism (affects _Factory_)

The _Hut_ have five grades of discount (from 0% to 
-115%), which are also set in the **Workshop** tab.

*Notice on Spaceport*

The _Spaceport_ has unusual ratio for starchart.
Source code indicates the ratio of 1.35, but this is
misleading. 1.35 is not a direct ratio. Instead of
that, common ratio is multiplied by 1.35. So, if you
have no _metaphysics_ discounts, your ratio for starchart
will be 1.15\*1.35=1.5525.

However, if you HAVE _metaphysics_ upgrade, such as
_Enlightenment_, common ratio WILL receive a discount,
but 1.35 multiplier will not be affected. So, the ratio
will be 1.14\*1.35=1.539.
